\chapter{Introduction}

This dissertation discusses two problems that are more or less unrelated apart from having a common origin in soft-matter physics.
The concepts used for the discussion have their basis in a potpourri of fields ranging from classical and quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics to engineering, with an emphasis on geometric and asymptotic methods.

\section{Frameworks, thermal fluctuations, and free energy landscapes}

Simply put, a bar-joint mechanism is a deformable assembly of bars that connect freely rotating joints. Such mechanisms have served as highly idealized representations of mechanical structures that underlie a plethora of soft few-body systems, e.g., colloidal clusters, proteins, viruses, etc. More recently, DNA origami has made it possible to make these mechanisms at the nanoscale, where they undergo low-temperature thermal fluctuations due to the surrounding medium. Although the bars in a mechanism are only stiff and not rigid, it is useful to analyze a mecha- nism in the limit that the bars become fully rigid, i.e., when the bar lengths are fixed. Indeed, such a situation is an instance of a holonomically constrained classical system, often encountered in elementary mechanics.
However, the imposed holonomic constraints need not always be well-behaved.
To illustrate this point more generally, consider a particle constrained to move on two intersecting cylinders of equal radius with mutually perpendicular axes [Fig. 1(a)].
The configuration space of this particle is not a smooth manifold, precisely because the cylinders have a nontransversal intersection at two singular points, where they share a common tangent plane.
Such singularities, which arise when the constraints imposed on a system cease to be linearly independent, are not mere pathological irregularities, and they have been extensively studied in many fields, e.g., robotics and locomotion.

To shed some more light on the above discussion, consider a mechanical system with $n$ \ac{dof}, whose configuration at any given moment is fully described by a single configuration vector $\bm{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$.
Constraints in such a system are most clearly introduced by defining a constraint map $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$
that vanishes when the constraints are satisfied, with $m$ being the number of constraints introduced.
The map $f$ is a general nonlinear map in $\bm{q}$ and its linear approximation is given by the $m\times n$ Jacobian matrix $\nabla f$.
Constraints in the two-cylinder system in Fig.~XXX, for instance is defined by the map $f(x, y, z) = (x^{2} + z^{2} - 1,\, y^{2} + z^{2} - 1)$.
With these definitions, the configuration space of the system is $\Sigma = \left\{\bm{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n} : f(\bm{q}) = \bm{0}\right\}$, which is the set of points where the constraints are satisfied exactly.
Standard theorems in manifold theory% 
\footnote{These theorems are almost never explicitly invoked in classical mechanics.
However, they are implicit in the frequently used argument that a mechanical system with $n$ degrees of freedom and $m$ constraints have $(n-m)$ degrees of freedom, with the configuration space $\Sigma$ parameterizable by $(n-m)$ generalized coordinates.}
ensure that $\Sigma$ is a smooth $(n-m)$-dimensional manifold if the Jacobian $\nabla f$ has full rank for all points in $\Sigma$.
At singularities, such as the ones in Fig.~XXX, the Jacobian $\nabla f$ drops rank%
\footnote{Since the Jacobian is an $m\times n$ matrix, it drops rank whenever its rows---each representing a single linearized constraint---cease to become linearly independent.}
and $\Sigma$ fails to be a manifold.

In practice, there is no such thing as a system with perfect constraints, and it is always possible to violate them by paying some sort of an energy cost.
For realistic systems, the set $\Sigma$ would then form the ground-state manifold (assuming no other sources of energy).
At the most basic level, we can assume that energy $U$ of a stiffly constrained system depends only the value of the constraint map $f(\bm{q})$, so that we can take $U \equiv U[f(\bm{q})]$ with $U$ having a minimum for all points on $\Sigma$ where $f(\bm{q}) = \bm{0}$.

To see this at an even elementary level, assume that we have just one constraint so that the constraint map $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ and the Jacobian $\nabla f$ is just the gradient of $f$.
Taylor expanding the energy to $\mathcal{O}(\Abs{\bm{q}}^{2})$, we get the familiar Harmonic approximation result
%
\begin{equation}
  U[f(\bm{q})] \approx \tfrac{1}{2}U''\left[f(0)\right]\left(\nabla f\cdot \bm{q}\right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
%
Clearly, near points where $\nabla f$ vanishes (which is the equivalent of a rank-deficient Jacobian for a scalar map $f$) the harmonic approximation would give $U \approx 0$.
This shows that in the vicinity of points where $\nabla f$ becomes vanishingly small, we need to expand $U$ beyond the harmonic order for any meaningful description of the energy landscape.
Higher-order corrections to $U$ are usually weaker (after all $\Abs{\bm{q}}$ is assumed to be small), and consequently the system becomes energetically soft.
Although we restricted ourselves to the case with just one constraint here, the situation is analogous when there are more.


\section{Thin structures, elastic waves, and bound states}

Time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a particle in a potential $V(x)$
%
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\partial_{x}^{2}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x),
\end{equation}
%
The semiclassical approximation is often introduced as the limit where the (reduced) Planck's constant $\hbar \to 0$.
Without additional clarifications, such a limit makes no sense as $\hbar$ is a fundamental constant, whose value is fixed by the units we choose to work in.
If the problem has an energy scale $U$ and a length scale $L$, we can nondimensionalize the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation by setting $x \to Lx$, $E \to UE$, and $V(x) \to UV(x)$, to obtain
%
\begin{equation}
  -\epsilon^{2}\partial_{\tilde{x}}^{2}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x),
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon = \hbar/\sqrt{2mL^{2}U}$, is now a dimensionless parameter.
The term in the denominator, $\sqrt{2mL^{2}U}$ has the dimension of the angular momentum.
Therefore, in considering the limit $\hbar \to 0$, we are considering the limit where the value of $\hbar$ is much smaller compared to the angular momentum scale, which is often the case with macroscopic systems described by classical physics.
