    \small This thesis was produced using \LaTeX---a set of macros for the {\TeX} typesetting system---and the \emph{memoir} class.
    Figures and plots were created using a combination of Inkscape, Matplotlib, POV-Ray, and Mathematica.
    The body text is set in 10~pt \emph{Utopia} and the text in the figures is set in 8/7~pt \emph{{\TeX} Gyre Heros}, a free clone of \emph{Helvetica}.
    Chapter and section headings are set in \emph{Roboto} and Mathematics is set in Fourier-GUT\emph{enberg}.\\\\ 
    Much time was saved during the writing of this thesis thanks to several free and open source software including
    BibTool,
    Debian GNU/Linux,
    GNU Core Utils and Bash,
    Git,
    Inkscape,
    \LaTeXe (from \TeX~Live),
    Matplotlib,
    Python,
    Vim,
    and Vim\TeX.
