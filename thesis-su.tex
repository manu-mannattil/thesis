%      Guidelines for Doctoral Dissertations and Master's Theses
%      ---------------------------------------------------------
%
%   Font: Type must be 12 pt minimum (footnotes may be 9 pt).
%
%   Spacing: Document should be double-spaced. Long quotations and
%   footnotes may be single-spaced.
%
%   Margins: Margins must be 1" at top, right, left, and bottom margins.
%
%   Justification: Justification should be left only.
%
%   Tables and Figures: Tables and figures should be consecutively
%   numbered.
%
%   Pagination:
%
%     Prefatory Pages: The prefatory pages, all of the pages preceding
%     the main body of the text, must be consecutively numbered in small
%     Roman numerals, centered at the bottom of the page. Numbers do not
%     appear on the Abstract, Title Page, or Copyright Page. However,
%     please note that these pages are included in the page count. For
%     example, in a typical dissertation, the Abstract is considered the
%     first page, the Title Page is considered the second and the
%     Copyright Page is considered the third.
%
%   Body of Text:
%
%     The body of the text, including Chapter Pages, Graphs, Tables,
%     Photographs, Bibliography, and Appendices must be consecutively
%     numbered in Arabic numerals in a consistent position beginning
%     with "1." The preferred position is the upper right hand corner.
%     Page numbers should be placed so that they appear clearly separate
%     from the body of the text, but no closer than 1/2-inch to the edge
%     of the paper. Please make certain that the pagination is correct.
%     Pages that are misnumbered will delay the processing of your
%     dissertation.
%
% Organization of the document:
%
%   1. Abstract (required) -- Page is counted but number does not appear
%      on typed page.
%

%      defense or document submission) this should be June 2012, August
%      2012, December 2012, or May 2013. Page is counted but number does
%      not appear on typed page.
%
%   3. Copyright notice (required) - Page is counted but number does not
%      appear on typed page.
%
%   4. Acknowledgments (optional) -- Page is counted. If it is included,
%      this will be the first page to display a number. Number with

%      appear on typed page. Number with a lower case Roman numeral

%      bottom of the page.
%
%   6. List of Illustrative materials (if applicable) -- number with
%      Roman numeral. If included type number on page. The number should
%      appear centered at the bottom of the page.
